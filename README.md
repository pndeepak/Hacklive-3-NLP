## Problem statement
  In real world scenario many research institutes go through huge archives of research papers, in such scenario tagging of research papers manually becomes a tedious task. The   objective of this ML problem is to automatically tag the research paper in any of the 25 possible tags.

## Type of Machine Learning Problem
  Since there are 25 different labels and each research paper may belong to one or more category this is a multilabel classification problem

## Performance metric
  Micro F1 score
